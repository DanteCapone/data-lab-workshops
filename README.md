# OOI Ocean Data Labs Workshops

This repository contains Python scripts developed for the [2019 OOI Ocean Data Labs Development workshops](https://datalab.marine.rutgers.edu/workshops/development-workshops/), hosted by Rutgers University.

Tutorials and examples presented during the workshops can be found in the [Summer_Examples](Summer_Examples/) directory

At each workshop, participants selected an OOI dataset to incorporate into an online interactive widget on the [Data Explorations](https://datalab.marine.rutgers.edu/explorations/) site.  As part of the development of each widget, a corresponding python notebook was developed to demonstrate how to request, download, clean and merge the OOI dataset into the file used by the widgets.  You can find these notebooks in the following folders.

* [March 2019](March2019/Activities/) @ Chauncey Center, Princeton, NJ
* [June 2019](June2019/) @ Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ
* [July 2019](July2019/) @ Asilomar, Pacific Grove, CA
* [August 2019](August2019/) @ Western Washington University, Bellingham, WA
